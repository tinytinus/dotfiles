# Dotfiles
my personal dotfiles for linux + my wallpaper collection

## What i use:
	- Editor: neovim
	- WindowManager: bspwm + sxhkd
	- Compositor: picom
	- Bar: none (polybar config is archived)
	- Terminal: alacritty (kitty config is archived)

	- Colorscheme: gruvbox

All my configs are really minimal and mainly for function, i don't recomend using them but mabey they are a good starting point.
These configs are designed for a small laptop and try to be as space efficient as possible, no rounded corners or fluff.
